DB:

theree are two types of data bases

relations databases - RDMS

relational data base willl follow a set os schema and contains tables that are related to on other with some common colomns etc..

eh: IN project we have client, subclient, VNC, VLAN tables which are related to each other

non relational - will not have schemas or relations.

Python anywhere - one web app for free

we need to load our files to Python anywhere computers


1. we have to have the code on github
2. create a repo
3. copy only the required files like the actual code only to the git hub and not the libraries.
4. for libraries -
	pip freeze req.txt
this command will create a text file mentioning all the mandatory libraries that are required to run the project and the versions of it.

So we can use same file instead to upload on python everywhere.  So, Python anywhere will install all these requirements with required versions, by checking the requirements file.
