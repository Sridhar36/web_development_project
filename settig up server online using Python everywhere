theree are two types of data bases

relations databases - RDMS

relational data base willl follow a set os schema and contains tables that are related to on other with some common colomns etc..

eh: IN project we have client, subclient, VNC, VLAN tables which are related to each other

non relational - will not have schemas or relations.

Python anywhere - one web app for free

we need to load our files to Python anywhere computers


1. we have to have the code on github
2. create a repo
3. copy only the required files like the actual code only to the git hub and not the libraries.
4. for libraries -
	pip freeze req.txt
this command will create a text file mentioning all the mandatory libraries that are required to run the project and the versions of it.

So we can use same file instead to upload on python everywhere.  So, Python anywhere will install all these requirements with required versions, by checking the requirements file.

---------
on Python Anywhere:

1. clone repo -
-open bash from dashboard > it opens a linux terminal
- now clone using this command
git clone <https link of repo>

2. do an ls to see if the repo is present or you can even check files from dashboard.

3. You can access one free web app..
so click on web app.
- select the frameworks and all manually, i.e do the manual setup

------------------------

from dashboard > bash

to install python venv flask
1. mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 my-virtualenv  # use whichever python version you prefer
2. pip install flask

you have to see this "(my-virtualenv) 14:28" which means you are currently inside my-virtualenv which is the name you have given to your virtual env. Else hit this command "workon my-virtualenv"

3. pip install -r requirements.txt  > to install all the required libraries.
